AX.25 Stuff

The Ideas came with this Project. So some of this code is really crappie.
I'll change this from time to time ..  ( Hopefully )

I just wanted to see if I could decode AX.25 myself, but now it looks like it can get more.
At this time it's just a bunch of testing stuff.

README will be updated soon.
